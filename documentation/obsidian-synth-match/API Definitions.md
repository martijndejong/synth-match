**Send target parameters & generate target sound**
- **Input**
	- Synth parameters
	- Note length (disabled for now)
	- Note (C4 etc - disabled for now)
	- (Later we would like to specify n_mels & hop_len, but out of scope for now)
- **Return**
	- Target Sound (virtualized?) - same resolution as in Environment
	- Target Spectrogram - same resolution as in Environment, maybe bit reduced
	- ~~(Target ADSR point values (depends if the logic is centralized in the BE or not))~~
	- **Potential format**:
		- {
			- target_sound: {
					- Float array [x * 1] - TBD if and how we will handle stereo
				- },
			- target_spectogram: {
				- - Float array [m x n] - TBD - format can later change depending on n_mels & hop_len
			- }
		- }
